    "## Introduction to QUEENS\n",
    "QUEENS is a versatile software framework offering a wide range of cutting-edge algorithms for deterministic and probabilistic analyses, including parameter studies, sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian inverse analysis. Built with a modular architecture, QUEENS enables efficient parallel queries of large-scale computational models, robust handling of data and resources, seamless switching between analysis types, and smooth scalability from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. To learn more, visit the QUEENS [website](https://www.queens-py.org), explore the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/queens-py), or check out the [documentation](https://queens-py.github.io/queens).\n",
